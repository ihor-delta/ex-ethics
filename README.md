# Ethics of Existance

As part of the discussion, I will try to answer the question: _"in what manner should we exist in reality, in the sense of how should we act in relation to reality?"_

## Why I call it "Ethics of Existance"?

This name was chosen as the most suitable within the framework of the ethics of human existence because this discussion answers the question: _How should we exist in reality [what should we do and in what manner]?_

# Manifest

Further I will use word "researcher" to mark an individual (a representative of subjective reality).

The main idea of this discussion is the actions of the researcher, which are not limited to the context of society, but are directed towards reality as a whole.

The question of the researcher’s spirituality will be omitted within the framework of these discussions.  I will try to give a theoretical justification for ethics (the principle of action).

Also, within the framework of the ethics of existence (hereinafter - ethics), we dare to talk not about an action that occurs in reality, but about an action aimed at reality - that is, about a certain thinking action (operation) carried out on the reality itself of the researcher before directing  action into reality.

# Discussion

For now, or completely, we cannot go beyond the spatio-temporal limitations of our reality, which means we have to exist within these limitations.  A change in this state of affairs will inevitably lead to the collapse of systems existing in reality, to a change in the patterns arising from these restrictions, which are the basis for stable activity.  

The motive of society is the common good.  What is the motive of human existence? The answer is the achievement of some idea of reality.  

We exist within the framework of a certain state of affairs in reality, mastering the patterns based on this state of affairs, adjusting our actions in order to achieve another, necessary for us, state of affairs - the ideal.

Within the reality of the researcher, a necessary condition for the ethics of his existence is the correlation of his ideal with the ideal of the common good of society. This process is possible only if the stability condition of both of these systems is met.

The ideal is a difficult thing to achieve, and therefore I dare to talk about goal setting to achieve it. The goal is the following: to achieve a state of stability for the researcher/society, which will be the basis for achieving it (ideal). The main feature of the required level of stability in the context of the ideal motive is the absence of crises that increase the risk of collapse of the system (researcher or society). 

Crises seem inevitable, but if you develop an approach to resolving them, they become part of the process of stability.

## What is stability?

Stability implies the presence of a certain unchangeable structure of the system, which will lead to the stable nature of its functioning. In my opinion, the achievement of such a structure of society is an indicator of the achievement of the common good, which will be the basis for achieving stability of its (society’s) representatives.

## Tendency to Change

Reality have a tendency to change even without the effectual participation of the researcher.
