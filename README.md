# Ethics of Existance

As part of the discussion, I will try to answer the question: _"in what manner should we exist in reality, in the sense of how should we act in relation to reality?"_

## Why I call it "Ethics of Existance"?

This name was chosen as the most suitable within the framework of the ethics of human existence because  This discussion answers the question: _How should we exist in reality?_

# Manifest

Further I will use word "researcher" to mark an individual (a representative of subjective reality).

The main idea of this discussion is the actions of the researcher, which are not limited to the context of society, but are directed towards reality as a whole.

The question of the researcher’s spirituality will be omitted within the framework of these discussions.  I will try to give a theoretical justification for ethics (the principle of action).
